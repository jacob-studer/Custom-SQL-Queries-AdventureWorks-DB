# Custom-SQL-Queries-AdventureWorks-DB

Hello! This is a repository showcasing my knowledge of Data Manipulation in SQL. It contains various Queries, Updates, Inserts, and Deletions from the 2012 Microsfot AdventureWorks database.

All Queries were written by me to solve user case scenarios that I came up with myself.

All of these are ran with T-SQL on the Microsoft SSMS.

AdventureWorks 2012 db can be downloaded from this URL:
