# Custom-SQL-Queries-AdventureWorks-DB

This repository has evolved through many different stages through its lifecycle to what it is now. I consider it to be the most up to date show of my SQL knowledge.

Hello! This is a repository showcasing my knowledge of Data Manipulation in SQL. It contains various Queries, Updates, Inserts, and Deletions from the 2012 Microsoft AdventureWorks database.

(Currently a work in progress)

All of these are ran with T-SQL on the Microsoft SSMS.

AdventureWorks 2012 db can be downloaded from this URL:
