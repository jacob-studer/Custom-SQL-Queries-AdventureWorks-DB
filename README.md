# Custom-SQL-Queries-AdventureWorks-DB

Hello! This is a repository showcasing my knowledge of Data Manipulation in SQL. It contains various Queries, Updates, Inserts, and Deletions from the 2012 Microsfot AdventureWorks database.

(Currently a work in progress)

All Queries were written by me to solve user case scenarios that either I came up with myself, or was presented to me in the training guide I was learning from.

All of these are ran with T-SQL on the Microsoft SSMS.

AdventureWorks 2012 db can be downloaded from this URL:
